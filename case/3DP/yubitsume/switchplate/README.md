# KLOR YUBITSUME 3DP CASE SWITCHPLATE

You need a black 1.5mm switchplate. You can use the **.dxf** or **.svg** file to get a switchplate made of black POM or anodized aluminium.\
Alternatively you can use the **.stl** to 3D print the switchplate.\
Another option is to order a FR4 switchplate by uploading the **.zip** file, containing the gerbers, to a PCB manufacture like [JLCPCB](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote).
You can keep the base settings, except of these:

- PCB Thickness : 1.2 or 1.6 mm
- PCB Color : Black
- Remove Order Number : Yes
